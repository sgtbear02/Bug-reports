**Describe the bug**
vanilla and some mod recipes do not work even if i use the default scroll. for example, the normal chest does not work when trying to craft it, the outcome is just blank , same thing with the furnace pet and a generator. havent been able to try other recipes just yet. the game itself does not crash or cause any application problems, its just the crafting itself

**Steps to reproduce**
How to reproduce the bug goes here. 
For example:
Step 1: try and craft a chest 
Step 2: the recipe will not work, the outcome is blank

**Expected Behavior**
i expected to get a random recipe, but not even that showed up
